# KMeans_student_habits_performance
Habits vs Academic Performance — K-Means Clustering
Project Summary

This project analyzes how student habits relate to academic performance using exploratory data analysis and unsupervised machine learning. Feature scaling, the elbow method, and K-Means clustering are applied to identify distinct behavior-performance student segments.

Key Skills Demonstrated

Data cleaning and feature selection

Exploratory data analysis and visualization

Feature scaling for distance-based models

Optimal cluster selection using the elbow method

K-Means clustering and interpretation of results

Analysis Workflow

Data Preparation
Removed non-informative identifiers and selected numeric features relevant to habits and performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyzed feature distributions, skewness, and relationships using descriptive statistics and histograms.

Modeling
Scaled features and applied the elbow rule to select the optimal number of clusters, followed by K-Means clustering.

Interpretation
Identified distinct student groups with different habit patterns and academic outcomes.

Results

The clustering highlights meaningful behavior-based performance patterns, demonstrating how habit-related features can align with different academic profiles.
